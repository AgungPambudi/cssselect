Planned for future versions
===========================

* Separate the XPath translation from the parsed objects into its own
  class, so that it can be overridden through inheritance.
* Give the docs some love


Version 0.2
===========

Not released yet.

* Remove the CSSSelector class. (The css_to_xpath function is now the
  main API.)
* Remove support for the ``:contains()`` pseudo-class.

These changes allow cssselect to be used without lxml. (Hey, this was
the whole point of this project.) The tests still require lxml, though.
The removed parts are expected to stay in lxml for backward-compatibility.

:contains() only existed in an `early draft
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/#content-selectors>`_
of the Selectors specification, and was removed before Level 3 stabilized.
Internally, it used a custom XPath extension function which can be
diffuclt to express outside of lxml.


Version 0.1
===========

Released on 2012-04-13.

Extract lxml.cssselect from the rest of lxml and make it a stand-alone project.

The 'master' branch from lxml’s git repository was taken on 2012-04-11
(commit ea53ceaf7e44ba4fbb5c818ae31370932f47774e). This is somewhere
between versions 2.3.4 and 2.4.

The commit history has been rewritten to:

* Remove lxml files unrelated to cssselect
* Import the early history from the 'html' branch in the old SVN repository
* Fix author names in commits from SVN

This project has its own import name, tests and documentation. But the
code itself is unchanged and still depends on lxml.
