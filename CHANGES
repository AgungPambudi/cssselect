Version 0.2
===========

**Planned:**

* Make cssselect usable without lxml. (Hey, this is the whole point of
  extracting it.) The tests will still require lxml, though.
  This probably implies removing the CSSSelector class.
  (Will it stay in lxml?)
* Separate the XPath translation from the parsed objects into its own
  class, so that it can be overrided through inheritance.
* Give the docs some love


Version 0.1
===========

Extract lxml.cssselect from the rest of lxml and make it a stand-alone project.

The 'master' branch from lxml’s git repository was taken on 2012-04-11
(commit ea53ceaf7e44ba4fbb5c818ae31370932f47774e). This is somewhere
between versions 2.3.4 and 2.4.

The commit history has been rewritten to:

* Remove lxml files unrelated to cssselect
* Import the early history from the 'html' branch in the old SVN repository
* Fix author names in commits from SVN

This project has its own import name, tests and documentation. But the
code itself is unchanged and still depends on lxml.
