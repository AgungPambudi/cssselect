Planned
=======

* Give the docs some love
* Implement :target, :hover, :focus and :active as never matching
* Make a new HTML-specific Translator subclass. There, implement :enabled,
  :disabled, :link and :visited (with all links "not visited").
* Move :checked to the new HTMLTranslator, make it unsupported for
  "generic" XML.
* Add some support for pseudo-elements by separating them from the
  rest of the selector.
* Add specificity calculation.

Discussion is open if anyone is interested in implementing eg. :target or
:visited differently, but they can always do it in a Translator subclass.


Version 0.2
===========

Not released yet.

* Remove the CSSSelector class. (The css_to_xpath function is now the
  main API.)
* Remove support for the ``:contains()`` pseudo-class.

These changes allow cssselect to be used without lxml. (Hey, this was
the whole point of this project.) The tests still require lxml, though.
The removed parts are expected to stay in lxml for backward-compatibility.

:contains() only existed in an `early draft
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/#content-selectors>`_
of the Selectors specification, and was removed before Level 3 stabilized.
Internally, it used a custom XPath extension function which can be
difficult to express outside of lxml.


* Separate the XPath translation from the parsed objects into a new
  Translator class.
* Make css_to_xpath() accept a Translator instance as a parameter.

Subclasses of Translator can be made to change the way that some selector
(eg. a pseudo-class) is implemented.


Version 0.1
===========

Released on 2012-04-13.

Extract lxml.cssselect from the rest of lxml and make it a stand-alone project.

The 'master' branch from lxml’s git repository was taken on 2012-04-11
(commit ea53ceaf7e44ba4fbb5c818ae31370932f47774e). This is somewhere
between versions 2.3.4 and 2.4.

The commit history has been rewritten to:

* Remove lxml files unrelated to cssselect
* Import the early history from the 'html' branch in the old SVN repository
* Fix author names in commits from SVN

This project has its own import name, tests and documentation. But the
code itself is unchanged and still depends on lxml.
